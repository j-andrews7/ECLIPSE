ECLIPSE (**E**nhancer **C**alling and **L**inking with **I**ntegrated **P**rofiling and **S**tructure **E**valuation) provides a performant 
implementation of the [rank ordering of super enhancers (ROSE)](http://younglab.wi.mit.edu/super_enhancer_code.html) method for identifying super enhancers.
It provides options to increase the robustness of ROSE via signal transformations prior to thresholding and additional thresholding approaches.
It also increases flexibility by exposing parameters hidden in the original implementation.
ECLIPSE additionally contains novel functionality to identify sub-structural changes within enhancer regions between groups via sliding window and binning approaches.
It also contains visualization functions to generate high-quality plots of specific loci alongside arbitrary user-provided data.

This project was conceptualized for and initially developed during the [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital KIDS24 BioHackathon](https://github.com/stjude-biohackathon) by:
- Jared Andrews (team lead)
- Alyssa Obermayer
- Nicolas Peterson
- Kelly McCastlain
- Jacqueline Myers
- Avery Bradley

It even snagged a prize for "Most Technically Impressive" project.

**This package is under active development and may break at any time.**

# Introduction

**ECLIPSE** (**E**nhancer **C**alling and **L**inking with **I**ntegrated **P**rofiling and **S**tructure **E**valuation) provides a performant 
implementation of the [rank ordering of super enhancers (ROSE)](http://younglab.wi.mit.edu/super_enhancer_code.html) method for identifying super enhancers.
It provides options to increase the robustness of ROSE via signal transformations prior to thresholding and additional thresholding approaches.
It also increases flexibility by exposing parameters hidden in the original implementation.
ECLIPSE additionally contains novel functionality to identify sub-structural changes within enhancer regions between groups via sliding window and binning approaches.
It also contains visualization functions to generate high-quality plots of specific loci alongside arbitrary user-provided data.

## Installation

**ECLIPSE** is currently available on Github and can be installed as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("stjude-biohackathon/ECLIPSE")
```

## Usage

Given paths to a BAM file and a BED file of peaks, ROSE can be run with the `run_rose` function.
Optionally, a control BAM file for input or IgG from the same sample can be provided.

Alternatively, `bamFile` objects for the treatment and control signal and a `GRanges` object for the peaks can be provided.

The output is a `GRanges` object containing all putative enhancers with their super enhancer designation in the `super` metadata column.

Below is an example of running ROSE on a BAM file of H3K27ac MINT ChIP-seq, an [input control](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR056PPJ/) BAM file, and a BED file of peaks from [this ENCODE experiment of human naive B cells](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR660EVU/).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# We'll use the BiocFileCache package to download and cache the files, which will take a few minutes the first time they're used.
library(BiocFileCache)

# For annotation
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)

txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene
org.db <- org.Hs.eg.db

bfc <- BiocFileCache(ask = FALSE)
treat_url <- "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF993DJI/@@download/ENCFF993DJI.bam"
treat_path <- bfcrpath(bfc, treat_url)

control_url <- "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF821MAI/@@download/ENCFF821MAI.bam"
control_path <- bfcrpath(bfc, control_url)

peaks_url <- "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF590DFY/@@download/ENCFF590DFY.bed.gz"
peaks_path <- bfcrpath(bfc, peaks_url)

naiveB1_enhancers <- run_rose(treatment = treat_path, control = control_path, peaks = peaks_path,
                              txdb = txdb, org.db = org.db, stitch.distance = 12500, tss.exclusion.distance = 2500,
                              max.unique.gene.tss.overlap = 2)

naiveB1_enhancers
```

### Other Input Types

Though the example above uses BAM files, `run_rose` can also accept BigWig or bedGraph signal files, though doing so alters the coverage calculation. See `?run_rose` for more information.

### Visualization

Can't be a super enhancer package without the classic swoosh plot.

```{r}
plot_enhancer_curve(naiveB1_enhancers, factor_label = "H3K27ac")
```


## Comparison to Original ROSE Implementation

With default parameters, `run_rose` is an attempt to match the results from the original ROSE implementation as closely as possible.

For comparison's sake, here is the enhancer ranking curve from the original ROSE implementation for [H3K27ac Mint-ChIP-seq from
naive B cells](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR660EVU/) as provided by ENCODE:

```{r, fig.cap="Enhancer rank plot output by original ROSE implementation.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ENCFF590DFY_Plot_points.png")
```

These results are using no TSS exclusion to compare the underlying classification approach as closely as possible.

Notably, the number of super-enhancers identified are not a perfect match due to very slight differences in the coverage calculations.
However, all super-enhancers identified in the original implementation are also called by ECLIPSE.
Determination of the root cause of the minor discrepancy is ongoing.

## Running with TSS Exclusion

ROSE is frequently ran with TSS exclusion to remove peaks fully contained within a window (usually +/- 2.5kb) around each TSS.

What is less well documented in the original ROSE implementation is that this also invokes an unstitching process of regions that span TSSes (+/- 50 bp) from 3 or more unique genes, whereby a stitched region is then split back into its original constituent elements. 

The original implementation provides no way to alter or disable this behavior, but ECLIPSE does.

```{r}
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene)
#txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene

# With TSS exclusion and unstitching, a la the original ROSE implementation
res_tss_exl <- run_rose(treatment = treat_path, 
                        control = control_path, 
                        peaks = peaks_path,
                        txdb = txdb,
                        tss.exclusion.distance = 2500,
                        max.unique.gene.tss.overlap = 2)

# With TSS exclusion but no unstitching
res_tss_exl_no_unstitch <- run_rose(treatment = treat_path, 
                                    control = control_path, 
                                    peaks = peaks_path,
                                    txdb = txdb,
                                    tss.exclusion.distance = 2500,
                                    max.unique.gene.tss.overlap = NULL)
```

We can then see how these differ in the number of SEs identified.

With TSS exclusion and unstitching, as is commonly done with the original implementation for H3K27ac data:

```{r}
plot_enhancer_curve(res_tss_exl, factor_label = "H3K27ac")
```

With TSS exclusion but no unstitching:

```{r}
plot_enhancer_curve(res_tss_exl_no_unstitch, factor_label = "H3K27ac")
```

These settings have dramatic impacts on the final number of regions returned and the number (and size) of SEs identified.

```{r}
message("Number of regions returned with TSS exclusion and unstitching: ", length(res_tss_exl))
message("Number of regions returned with TSS exclusion and no unstitching: ", length(res_tss_exl_no_unstitch))

message("Number of SEs identified with TSS exclusion and unstitching: ", length(res_tss_exl[res_tss_exl$super]))
message("Number of SEs identified with TSS exclusion and no unstitching: ", length(res_tss_exl_no_unstitch[res_tss_exl_no_unstitch$super]))

message("Average width of SEs with TSS exclusion and unstitching: ", mean(width(res_tss_exl[res_tss_exl$super])))
message("Average width of SEs with TSS exclusion and no unstitching: ", mean(width(res_tss_exl_no_unstitch[res_tss_exl_no_unstitch$super])))
```


Given the lack of documentation or discussion on this behavior in the original implementation or papers, it is unclear how this should be handled in practice.

## Differential Sub-Structural Analysis

ECLIPSE also provides functionality to identify sub-structural changes within super enhancer regions between groups via differential analysis of small bins.

For this example, we'll compare naive B cells and activated B cells from ENCODE.
These groups have enough similarities to demonstrate how this analysis looks for similar regions, but also enough changes in SE structure to be interesting.

### Call Activated B Cell Super Enhancers

We'll also want the SEs from activated B cells so that we have all the SE regions between the groups included for comparison.
This is also useful for classification of SE structure changes between groups (see below).

```{r}
actB1_url <- "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF640GBC/@@download/ENCFF640GBC.bam"
actB1_path <- bfcrpath(bfc, actB1_url)

control_actB1_url <- "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF391WGD/@@download/ENCFF391WGD.bam"
control_actB1_path <- bfcrpath(bfc, control_actB1_url)

peaks_actB1_url <- "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF915WBP/@@download/ENCFF915WBP.bed.gz"
peaks_actB1_path <- bfcrpath(bfc, peaks_actB1_url)

actB1_enhancers <- run_rose(treatment = actB1_path, control = control_actB1_path, peaks = peaks_actB1_path)
```

Now we can merge the activated and naive B cell super enhancers.

```{r}
naiveB1_SEs <- naiveB1_enhancers[naiveB1_enhancers$super]
actB1_SEs <- actB1_enhancers[actB1_enhancers$super]
all_SEs <- rbind(naiveB1_SEs, actB1_SEs)

# Merge overlapping SEs between the groups
all_SEs <- reduce(all_SEs)

# Add a REGION_ID column to keep track of which bins came from which SEs for differential analysis.
mcols(all_SEs)$REGION_ID <- seq_along(all_SEs)
```


### Loading Additional Replicates

Now we need signal counts for additional replicates in each group.
Note that we could call SEs from each sample individually before merging, or use more complicated strategies to derive SEs to compare, e.g. overlap in some proportion of samples.

```{r}
naiveB2_url <- "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF808SRS/@@download/ENCFF808SRS.bam"
naiveB2_path <- bfcrpath(bfc, naiveB2_url)

actB2_url <- "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF267CCT/@@download/ENCFF267CCT.bam"
actB2_path <- bfcrpath(bfc, actB2_url)
```

### Differential Analysis

Now we can actually do our differential analysis.
This will compose of:

- Splitting each SE into 100 bp bins.
- Counting the signal in each bin for each replicate.
- Dropping very low signal bins.
- Run DESeq2 with pretty standard paramaeters.
- Apply LFC shrinkage.
- Merge significant bins that are within 300 bp of each other.

```{r}
library(DESeq2)
library(apeglm)

# Break into bins
se_gr_binned <- unlist(tile(all_SEs, width=100))
mcols(se_gr_binned) <- rep(mcols(all_SEs)["REGION_ID"], elementNROWS(tile(all_SEs, width=100)))

# Count reads in each bin.
se_gr_binned_counts <- regionCounts(bam.files = c(naiveB1_path, naiveB2_path, treat_path, actB2_path), 
                                    regions = se_gr_binned, 
                                    ext = 200, 
                                    param = readParam(minq = 20))

se_gr_binned_counts$group <- c(rep("naive_Bcell", 2), rep("activated_Bcell", 2))

# Drop very low count bins
smallestGroupSize <- 2
keep <- rowSums(counts(dds) >= 20) >= smallestGroupSize
dds <- dds[keep,]

dds <- DESeq(dds)
rezzy <- results(dds, contrast = c("group", "naive_Bcell", "activated_Bcell"), alpha = 0.05, lfcThreshold = log2(1.25))
res <- lfcShrink(dds, res = rezzy, coef = c("group_naive_Bcell_vs_activated_Bcell"), type = "apeglm", format = "GRanges", saveCols = "REGION_ID")
```

### Rank SEs by Number of Significant Bins Altered

To get an idea of which SEs may be affected.

```{r}
sig <- res[res$padj < 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj),]

# Get table of bins altered in each REGION_ID, ranked by count
db.ses <- as.data.frame(sig) %>% group_by(REGION_ID) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% arrange(desc(n))

# To se_gr, add columns for number of sig bins based on matching REGION_ID
# Get db SE IDs
db.ids <- se_gr$REGION_ID %in% db.ses$REGION_ID

se_gr$NUM_ALTERED_BINS <- 0
se_gr$NUM_ALTERED_BINS[db.ids] <- db.ses$n[match(se_gr$REGION_ID[db.ids], db.ses$REGION_ID)]
```

### Merge Adjacent/Nearby Bins for Highlighting

This will get us a more interpretable set of regions to investigate.

```{r}
merged_sig <- mergeWindows(sig, tol = 300, max.width = 5000)

merged_regions <- merged_sig$regions

# Limit to those that are at least 3 bins wide
merged_regions <- merged_regions[width(merged_regions) >= 300]

# For testing, limit to those on chr6
merged_regions <- merged_regions[seqnames(merged_regions) == "chr2"]
```

### Visualization

Now we can do the usual viz, e.g. MA plots and tracks.
Depending on the groups being compared, you might expect larger shifts in the MA plot than you'd expect from a typical gene-level analysis.
SEs are relatively cell-type specific and somewhat dynamic, plus we'll be looking at the individual bins composing them.

A typical MA plot is of limited utility here, but we can still generate one.

```{r}
plotMA(rezzy, alpha = 0.05)
```

### Gviz Viz

This is a more complex example of how you might visualize the results of the differential analysis using Gviz.

```{r}
# Get region for SE with most DB bins
top.db <- db.ses$REGION_ID[66]
se.info <- se_gr[se_gr$REGION_ID == top.db,]

    "ENTREZID", multiVals = "first"))
